# EventNotifier
EventNotifier is my MSc project. The purpose of this project is to increase the influx of tourists towards locations through notification of tweeter users about events that fit their preferences.
These preferences can be determined through NLP and be sorted for each user and stored in a MySql database. 
Python Modules used:
MysqlDB
Tweepy
NLTK
